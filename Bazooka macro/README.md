◕General Tips:  Start with 0 or 5 stacks arcane dynamo before using a macro; using only channeling helps while in sanc (if ground stomp barb, careful where your extra black holes from channeling are going).

150 strat to get good first occy. Open the GR, get 4+ stacks of gogok, pop Archon mid fire, do a shot (occy shot macro) to soften things up in arcane, then do one full rotation of occy shot, archon shot.
